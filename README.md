# DNS-Server

Public ISP / DNS Servers
-------------------------------------

This list should be used as a record if someone wants to block countries using Pi-Hole. If you want to use it for Pi-Hole, either copy the domain list from "https://public-dns.info/" in order to use most of it. However, the same issue of blocking domains through the URL in Pi-Hole could take time to update.

It's possible to combine multiple continents' blocking DNS servers and ISP DNS servers, but if your choice wants to make your list, If you use it, there is a folder called "All in One DNS Servers" that has combined all ISP and public DNS servers; however, keep in mind that this will not update the latest DNS server.

Software Used:

- Pi-Hole

Credits
-------------------

The people who maintain "public-dns.info" to create custom blocklists for specific countries deserve credit.
